## What you need
The following packages will need to be installed in R to run my project if they are not already:
* nflfastR
* nflreadr
* nflplotR
* tidyverse
* ggimage
* eeptools
* gt
* MLmetrics
* remotes
* scales

## What you should do

If you want to run all of the code step by step, feel free to open the .RMD file and run each chunk individually. If not, you can see all of the code and output in the .html file. All of the data is loaded in from the nflfastR API,
so no data files are required.
